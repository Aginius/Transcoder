# Transcoder
It transcodes files between different programming languages, currently supporting from C (and C syntax based languages) to Python.
It is written to be scalable and modular, so it's easy to implement new languages both in input and output.
The program just takes a file in input, translates it to pseudo-code, and then translates it back to the output file in the chosen language.
